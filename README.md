![Alt Text](capstone_images/protest.jpg)


### Introduction: 

* A dataset from the Stanford Open Policing Project contains details on several years' of police traffic stops in Louisville, Kentucky. I examined the data with the goal of determining whether race played a role in the outcomes of traffic stops in Louisville. As it did across the U.S., the issue of race and policing dominated headlines last year in Louisville, where the police shooting of Breonna Taylor in March was a factor in sparking nationwide protests. 

#### The data:
